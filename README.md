Scenario Description:

Our company, Dawg Fitness, is a large fitness enterprise with multiple gym locations across the United States, with each gym serving as the core of our operations. While all gyms operate under Dawg Fitness, each location offers tailored services to meet the diverse needs of its members. Our goal is to create a relational database that connects all relevant entities across the business. This database will manage key information such as gym details, member profiles, trainers, equipment inventory, class schedules, membership plans, payment history, and survey feedback. By leveraging this data, we aim to structure queries that provide valuable insights for improving and growing Dawg Fitness' operations.
